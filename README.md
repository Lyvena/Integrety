Welcome to Integrety, the official open source version that allows you to choose the LLM that you use for each prompt! Currently, you can use OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, LMStudio, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace, DeepSeek, or Groq models - and it is easily extended to use any other model supported by the Vercel AI SDK! See the instructions below for running this locally and extending it to include more models.

Check the [Integrety Docs](https://stackblitz-labs.github.io/integrety/) for more official installation instructions and more information.

Also [this pinned post in our community](https://thinktank.ottomator.ai/t/videos-tutorial-helpful-content/3243) has a bunch of incredible resources for running and deploying Integrety yourself! We have also launched an experimental agent called the "Integrety Expert" that can answer common questions about Integrety. Find it here on the [oTTomator Live Agent Studio](https://studio.ottomator.ai/).
Integrety was originally started by [Cole Medin](https://www.youtube.com/@ColeMedin) but has quickly grown into a massive community effort to build the BEST open source AI coding assistant!
